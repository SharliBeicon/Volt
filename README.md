# Volt DAW

Volt is a custom DAW (digital audio workstation) that is primarily aimed at Linux and will be open-source. It uses eframe+egui for rendering, likely cpal for playback.
It will have its own .wav implementation to integrate nicely with the rest of the DAW (as it is the most widely used format in music production), and other formats will use libraries for compatibility.

Feel free to make improvements and additions to the DAW, and submit a PR!
Additionally, you can also open issues with the DAW.

## Current state

The DAW at the moment is highly unfinished and is currently primarily in the testing phase.
If anyone can volunteer to improve the DAW, please do! PRs are super welcome.
